# Tic Tac Toe

This is a terminal based implementation of the popular Tic Tac Toe game.

### File Setup

Make sure t3.c, t3.h, and Makefile are all in
the same directory and all named appropriately. To compile,
type 'make' into the terminal, there should be no errors or warnings.
You can start the game by typing './t3' into the command line.

## Playing The Game

```
./t3
```

### Local Game

The goal is to get 3 across, 3 down, or 3 diagonal. If the board fills 
up before that happens, then the game ends in a draw. The controls are pretty
simple, just type the number where you want to place your game piece that turn.
You will get to retry if your initial move is invalid. 

### Nonlocal Game

I made this is as a way to learn sockets, so I plan on updating the game with
networking capabilities.

## Troubleshooting

Make sure the program is compiled and all files have their original
names (as listed above). If you are still having issues, feel free to
